- Install plugin and activate

- You get a main menu "Inf Member", click on it to get this screen: 
  http://screencast.com/t/2uswJl4h8. 
  Need to place your subdomain from infusionsoft and api key as in screenshot, so that wp connects with infusionsoft.

- Now, click on Members submenu: 
  http://screencast.com/t/lrVBkDZQO. 
  As explained on screenshot, select the category from which tags need to be pulled. 
  Now, once you select the category and save, the dropdowns under heading Membership levels, will be filled with the tags, based on category you select. 

  You can create as many levels you want selecting, tags from first dropdown, place level as value, 1,2,etc, name your membership level name, 
  we have other 2 features, like you can choose to redirect users to different pages, based on their membership level once they login and logout for which you can see the two different dropdowns.

- Once you have everything set with the Membership level, click on options to set general options: 
  http://screencast.com/t/vOxw3JDz. 
  If you see, there are different options to choose from which are self explanatory and explained on screeshot as well.
  The only confusion is with the custom field as they mention one point related to it which was for password... need
  more explanation on it. Right now default password is: p@ssw0rd

 You can set to sync the user from infusionsoft or click on sync now to sync immediately. Once synced, user will be 
 created depending upon which tags they are, it will be assigned to that level.
